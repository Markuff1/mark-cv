I began supporting penetration testing efforts by retesting and validating security fixes provided by an external security provider. Additionally, I started contributing to our frontend React application, handling small UI and functionality fixes. I am currently exploring training opportunities to take on more advanced development tasks alongside my testing responsibilities.",
